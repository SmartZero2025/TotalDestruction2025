Description (concept) for this project (Game)

- full name: "Total Destruction 2025: Human Apocalypse"
- Genre: Realtime-Strategy/deep strategic Core with big dependencies (similar to old Anno-series), many kinds of ressources
- 50 enemy units, 50 friendly units
- campaign (~40 missions, based on script), will be story-based. 20 Missions on each side of enemy/friendly units
- 10 unique animations for each unit (idle) & 10 animations for rest, total: 1000 animations for 100 total units
- nextgen-animation engine (requires 1 lane/10 of IBM Espresso WiiU processor = lane configured as OUTPUT)
- 20 maps to choose from battling (standard battle)
- user can choose friendly or enemy side
- based on nextgen-software-rendering engine, no hardware accelleration used
- Fully Raytraced (approx. 1 Billion pixel-lights = target) => 4 lanes/10 required (configured as OUTPUT)
- target framerate: 60 fps
- Nextgen-Soundengine for good vibes (1 lane/10 required, configured as OUTPUT)
- Nextgen-AI (own custom AI-engine, based on scripting) 1 lane/10 required (configured as OUTPUT)
- some physics, like destruction of the ground & battlefield (1 lane/10 required, configured as OUTPUT)
- single platform only (WiiU)
- no lags, no latency,no input-lag!
- no constant patches required. No install. game will be tiny (approx 100-500 Mbytes)
- touchscreen-support targeted! (1 lane/10 required, configured as INPUT), mouse-support might be possible in future (requires additional lane configured as INPUT)
- resolution will be 720p or 1080p depending on how many ressources will be required for full raytracing
- internet-support battle is not planned for now but might be possible in the future
- Many parts of this game will run on assembler-routines via JAVA-implementation
- features realtime-hitboxes. there will be no "bad units" doing stuff what you don´t want. each enemy will have it´s own precise hitbox and will only do what you command it to do.
- each unit you control will have it´s own AI. You don´t have to control "squads"
- the framerate of 60 fps can only be guaranteed if the number of units on-screen doesn´t get higher than ~1000 units
- because of very high ressources requirements for nextgen-AI-/animation-engine there will be no high-quality assets with HD-resolution for textures! You will have some "pixel"-textures here and there, this is also to make sure the game doesn´t occupy gbytes of space
- game will use simple textures and standard-formats which look good enough, but won´t occupy too much space
- Game wil use a multithreaded complex code (6-threaded code, using all 10 cpu-buses of a WiiU´s Espresso chip, might become 7-threaded if game will make use of internet-connections for multiplayer online

Game engine: JAVA, Java SDK 8/9

Release/ETA: somewhere in late 2025!
